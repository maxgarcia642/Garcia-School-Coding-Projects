# Garcia-School-Coding-Projects

SUMMARY
A collection of my Python, Java, and C++ projects from high school and university computer science courses, showcasing programming fundamentals through creative challenges and tools.

INTRODUCTION
Welcome to my repository for computer science projects spanning High School, AP Computer Science (Java), and University Programming Foundations I (C++). This repository contains text files for different groups of projects developed during my academic career.

## Repository Contents

- Haas Hall Academy Bentonville High School Fall 2018 – Python Challenges for Computer Science Course
    This folder contains 27 Python challenges. Each challenge is implemented in its own function with a main menu that lets you select which challenge to run. The challenges cover a wide range of topics from basic list operations and string manipulation to more advanced problems such as reaction games and turtle-based clocks.

- Haas Hall Academy Bentonville High School Spring 2021 – Java Projects for AP Computer Science*  
    This folder includes 17 Java projects that showcase fundamental concepts in Java programming. Projects include a Heads or Tails Tool and a GPS program, along with other assignments related to the AP Computer Science curriculum.

- University of Arkansas Fall 2023 – C++ Projects for Programming Foundations I  
    This folder contains C++ projects that were developed as part of the university curriculum, including a Bike Race Calculator Tool and a Product Checkout simulation. Each project is organized with proper commenting and uses standard library functions to facilitate code understanding and reusability.

## How to Use

* Python Challenges
1. Open the corresponding Python challenge file in your Python IDE or text editor.
2. Run the file using Python 3.
3. Follow the on-screen menu to select a challenge, and read the inline comments for explanation.

* Java Projects
1. Each Java project is contained within its own source file.
2. Use your preferred Java IDE (such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA) to open, compile, and run the projects.
3. Detailed comments in the source code explain the functionality of each part of the project.

* C++ Projects
1. Each C++ project is provided as a separate file.
2. Open the files in your C++ IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, Code::Blocks) and compile them.
3. The projects include ample comments to help you understand the logic and flow of the code.

## About Me

I was a computer science enthusiast who did programming and problem solving for a couple of years before switching my major to Business Information Systems. This repository represents my growth through high school, AP Computer Science, and even at the university. I hope these projects help others who come across this repository and are starting their coding journey or looking for creative solutions to common programming challenges.

Feel free to explore the projects, use the code as a reference, or modify it to suit your needs. Feedback and contributions are welcome!
